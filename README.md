# images-compare
A simple offline browser tool for comparing a single source image with multiple variations. It helps to visualize exactly what a filter, AI model, or other software is doing.

This code was written almost entirely by Gemini 3.
The code successfully performs the task I designed it for.
There are a few minor bugs remaining. I will resolve the scaling issue (it went unnoticed before publishing as all images fit on my screen), but other fixes will be addressed next week at the earliest.
Libraries used: (will add later)
